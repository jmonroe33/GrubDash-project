# GrubDash-project
The goal of this project was to create the back end for a client that will be using this software for their resturant. This will give them the ablility to fullfill orders to clients in an orderly fashion.
Throught the code there are many comments describing how each function written handles a clients requests for basic CRUDL operations.

-- get requests
-- put requests
-- post requests
-- delete requests
